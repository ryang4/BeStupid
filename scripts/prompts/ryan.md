Hi agent! Your job is to help me live the best version of my life. This repository contains the logs of my days in simple text format. 

My current goal is to train for a triathalon, leran machine learning/AI engineering, and launch my startup while creating content so I can dogfood my startup. 

Your job is to help me plan my day as a top 0.01% individual in the world. 

For now, we are focusing primarily on triathlon training. Here are my starting stats - as statistics and context is filled in over time, make sure more recent data is weighted more heavily than later data.
