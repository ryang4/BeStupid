## 🤖 AI Rationale

This protocol is designed to establish a solid foundation for Ryan&#39;s transition into triathlon while maintaining his strength and supporting his startup goals. Given that this is the first week and there is no historical data, the focus is on building a base with a gradual increase in volume and a strong emphasis on technique. The schedule includes two strength sessions to ensure Ryan maintains his current PRs, which is crucial for long-term performance. The inclusion of a brick workout on Saturday provides a practical application of the skills learned and serves as a content creation opportunity. The long run on Sunday allows for building endurance and mental resilience, essential for both triathlon and startup success. The balance between triathlon training and deep work ensures that Ryan can sustain high performance across all areas.

</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>This protocol is designed to establish a solid foundation for Ryan&#39;s transition into triathlon while maintaining his strength and supporting his startup goals. Given that this is the first week and there is no historical data, the focus is on building a base with a gradual increase in volume and a strong emphasis on technique. The schedule includes two strength sessions to ensure Ryan maintains his current PRs, which is crucial for long-term performance. The inclusion of a brick workout on Saturday provides a practical application of the skills learned and serves as a content creation opportunity. The long run on Sunday allows for building endurance and mental resilience, essential for both triathlon and startup success. The balance between triathlon training and deep work ensures that Ryan can sustain high performance across all areas.
