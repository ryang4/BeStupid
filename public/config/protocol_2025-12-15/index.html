First swim today, focusing on technique.” Blog Draft “Week 1: Laying the Foundation - Swim, Bike, and Run Basics” YouTube Draft “Day 1 of Triathlon Training: Swim Technique Drills” 🤖 AI Rationale Given Ryan’s profile and the lack of historical data, this protocol focuses on establishing a solid base in swimming and cycling while maintaining his running endurance and strength. The initial swim volume is kept low to focus on technique, which is crucial for a beginner. Cycling starts with indoor training to build form and cadence, essential for efficient biking. Running remains at a moderate volume to leverage his existing base without overloading. Two strength sessions per week ensure he maintains his hard-earned gains. The startup goals are aligned with his MVP launch timeline, ensuring a balanced approach between training and deep work. The content strategy leverages his training experiences to build an engaged audience and validate his product.\n🧬 Human Notes [Placeholder for Ryan to add his own adjustments/notes]\nCRITICAL RULES:\nIf compliance was \u003e85% and sleep \u003e7hrs avg → Increase volume 5-10% If compliance was 70-85% → Hold volume steady If compliance was \u003c70% OR sleep \u003c6.5hrs avg → Reduce volume 10-20% Always include 2x strength sessions (maintain 300 DL, 225 squat) Balance triathlon + startup work (6+ hrs deep work/week) Saturday = brick workout + content creation Sunday = long run day (clear schedule, good for endurance) Monday = recovery/rest day always ",
