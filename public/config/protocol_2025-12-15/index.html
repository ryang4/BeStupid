First swim today, focusing on technique.” Blog Draft “Week 1: Laying the Foundation - Swim, Bike, and Run Basics” YouTube Draft “Day 1 of Triathlon Training: Swim Technique Drills” 🤖 AI Rationale Given Ryan’s profile and the lack of historical data, this protocol focuses on establishing a solid base in swimming and cycling while maintaining his running endurance and strength. The initial swim volume is kept low to focus on technique, which is crucial for a beginner. Cycling starts with indoor training to build form and cadence, essential for efficient biking. Running remains at a moderate volume to leverage his existing base without overloading. Two strength sessions per week ensure he maintains his hard-earned gains. The startup goals are aligned with his MVP launch timeline, ensuring a balanced approach between training and deep work. The content strategy leverages his training experiences to build an engaged audience and validate his product.\n🧬 Human Notes [Placeholder for Ryan to add his own adjustments/notes]\nCRITICAL RULES:\nIf compliance was \u003e85% and sleep \u003e7hrs avg → Increase volume 5-10% If compliance was 70-85% → Hold volume steady If compliance was \u003c70% OR sleep \u003c6.5hrs avg → Reduce volume 10-20% Always include 2x full body strength sessions (Tuesday/Friday) Balance triathlon + startup work (6+ hrs deep work/week) Saturday = brick workout + content creation Sunday = long run day (clear schedule, good for endurance) Monday = recovery/rest day always ",

<h2 id="-ai-rationale">🤖 AI Rationale<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-ai-rationale">#</a></h2>
<p>Given Ryan&rsquo;s profile and the lack of historical data, this protocol focuses on establishing a solid base in swimming and cycling while maintaining his running endurance and strength. The initial swim volume is kept low to focus on technique, which is crucial for a beginner. Cycling starts with indoor training to build form and cadence, essential for efficient biking. Running remains at a moderate volume to leverage his existing base without overloading. Two strength sessions per week ensure he maintains his hard-earned gains. The startup goals are aligned with his MVP launch timeline, ensuring a balanced approach between training and deep work. The content strategy leverages his training experiences to build an engaged audience and validate his product.</p>

<p>CRITICAL RULES:</p>
<ol>
<li>If compliance was &gt;85% and sleep &gt;7hrs avg → Increase volume 5-10%</li>
<li>If compliance was 70-85% → Hold volume steady</li>
<li>If compliance was &lt;70% OR sleep &lt;6.5hrs avg → Reduce volume 10-20%</li>
<li>Always include 2x full body strength sessions (Tuesday/Friday)</li>
<li>Balance triathlon + startup work (6+ hrs deep work/week)</li>
<li>Saturday = brick workout + content creation</li>
<li>Sunday = long run day (clear schedule, good for endurance)</li>
<li>Monday = recovery/rest day always</li>
</ol>
