The week starts with a recovery day to ensure he is well-rested for the upcoming challenges. The strength sessions are designed to maintain his current lifts while gradually increasing volume and intensity. The high-intensity cardio session on Wednesday provides a necessary metabolic challenge without interfering with the strength sessions. The swim workout on Thursday emphasizes technique, which is crucial for a beginner. The brick workout on Saturday combines biking and running, simulating race conditions and providing valuable content for his audience. The long run on Sunday helps build endurance and mental toughness. The startup goals are integrated to ensure that his business continues to progress alongside his training.\n🧬 Human Notes [Placeholder for Ryan to add his own adjustments/notes]\nCRITICAL RULES:\nIf compliance was \u003e85% and sleep \u003e7hrs avg → Increase volume 5-10% If compliance was 70-85% → Hold volume steady If compliance was \u003c70% OR sleep \u003c6.5hrs avg → Reduce volume 10-20% Always include 2x strength sessions (maintain 300 DL, 225 squat) Balance triathlon + startup work (6+ hrs deep work/week) Saturday = brick workout + content creation Sunday = long run day (clear schedule, good for endurance) Monday = recovery/rest day always HIGH INTENSITY CARDIO: Include exactly ONE high-intensity cardio session per week: Running intervals: 6x400m @ 5K pace with 90s jog recovery, OR 4x800m @ 10K pace Cycling intervals: 5x3min at threshold (RPE 8) with 2min easy spin Schedule on Wednesday or Thursday (NOT on heavy strength days) Alternate between running and cycling each week EXERCISE VARIETY: Ensure workout variety compared to last week: Rotate at least 2 accessory exercises (use variations: incline vs flat, dumbbell vs barbell) Vary rep ranges: if last week was 3x8, try 4x6 or 3x10 this week For cardio: if last week was steady-state, include intervals; if intervals, include a tempo run REFERENCE THE LAST WEEK’S PROTOCOL ABOVE - do not copy it exactly PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD: Use the exercise history data to set specific targets: Reference actual weights/reps from history, not just ryan.md defaults Apply progression recommendations from the history section above If no history for an exercise, use ryan.md baseline ",

<h2 id="-ai-rationale">🤖 AI Rationale<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-ai-rationale">#</a></h2>
<p>Given Ryan&rsquo;s current state and goals, this protocol focuses on building a solid foundation for his triathlon training while maintaining his strength and supporting his startup efforts. The week starts with a recovery day to ensure he is well-rested for the upcoming challenges. The strength sessions are designed to maintain his current lifts while gradually increasing volume and intensity. The high-intensity cardio session on Wednesday provides a necessary metabolic challenge without interfering with the strength sessions. The swim workout on Thursday emphasizes technique, which is crucial for a beginner. The brick workout on Saturday combines biking and running, simulating race conditions and providing valuable content for his audience. The long run on Sunday helps build endurance and mental toughness. The startup goals are integrated to ensure that his business continues to progress alongside his training.</p>

<p>CRITICAL RULES:</p>
<ol>
<li>If compliance was &gt;85% and sleep &gt;7hrs avg → Increase volume 5-10%</li>
<li>If compliance was 70-85% → Hold volume steady</li>
<li>If compliance was &lt;70% OR sleep &lt;6.5hrs avg → Reduce volume 10-20%</li>
<li>Always include 2x strength sessions (maintain 300 DL, 225 squat)</li>
<li>Balance triathlon + startup work (6+ hrs deep work/week)</li>
<li>Saturday = brick workout + content creation</li>
<li>Sunday = long run day (clear schedule, good for endurance)</li>
<li>Monday = recovery/rest day always</li>
<li>HIGH INTENSITY CARDIO: Include exactly ONE high-intensity cardio session per week:
<ul>
<li>Running intervals: 6x400m @ 5K pace with 90s jog recovery, OR 4x800m @ 10K pace</li>
<li>Cycling intervals: 5x3min at threshold (RPE 8) with 2min easy spin</li>
<li>Schedule on Wednesday or Thursday (NOT on heavy strength days)</li>
<li>Alternate between running and cycling each week</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>EXERCISE VARIETY: Ensure workout variety compared to last week:
<ul>
<li>Rotate at least 2 accessory exercises (use variations: incline vs flat, dumbbell vs barbell)</li>
<li>Vary rep ranges: if last week was 3x8, try 4x6 or 3x10 this week</li>
<li>For cardio: if last week was steady-state, include intervals; if intervals, include a tempo run</li>
<li>REFERENCE THE LAST WEEK&rsquo;S PROTOCOL ABOVE - do not copy it exactly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD: Use the exercise history data to set specific targets:
<ul>
<li>Reference actual weights/reps from history, not just ryan.md defaults</li>
<li>Apply progression recommendations from the history section above</li>
<li>If no history for an exercise, use ryan.md baseline</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
