The week starts with a recovery day to ensure Ryan is well-rested, followed by two strength sessions to preserve and build full-body strength. The inclusion of one high-intensity cardio session (running intervals) and one steady-state bike session helps build endurance and speed. The long run on Sunday and the brick workout on Saturday simulate race conditions and prepare Ryan for the demands of a half ironman.

<p>[Placeholder for Ryan to add his own adjustments/notes]</p>
<p>CRITICAL RULES:</p>
<ol>
<li>If compliance was &gt;85% and sleep &gt;7hrs avg → Increase volume 5-10%</li>
<li>If compliance was 70-85% → Hold volume steady</li>
<li>If compliance was &lt;70% OR sleep &lt;6.5hrs avg → Reduce volume 10-20%</li>
<li>Always include 2x strength sessions (maintain 300 DL, 225 squat)</li>
<li>Balance triathlon + startup work (6+ hrs deep work/week)</li>
<li>Saturday = brick workout + content creation</li>
<li>Sunday = long run day (clear schedule, good for endurance)</li>
<li>Monday = recovery/rest day always</li>
<li>HIGH INTENSITY CARDIO: Include exactly ONE high-intensity cardio session per week:
<ul>
<li>Running intervals: 6x400m @ 5K pace with 90s jog recovery, OR 4x800m @ 10K pace</li>
<li>Cycling intervals: 5x3min at threshold (RPE 8) with 2min easy spin</li>
<li>Schedule on Wednesday or Thursday (NOT on heavy strength days)</li>
<li>Alternate between running and cycling each week</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>EXERCISE VARIETY: Ensure workout variety compared to last week:
<ul>
<li>Rotate at least 2 accessory exercises (use variations: incline vs flat, dumbbell vs barbell)</li>
<li>Vary rep ranges: if last week was 3x8, try 4x6 or 3x10 this week</li>
<li>For cardio: if last week was steady-state, include intervals; if intervals, include a tempo run</li>
<li>REFERENCE THE LAST WEEK&rsquo;S PROTOCOL ABOVE - do not copy it exactly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD: Use the exercise history data to set specific targets:
<ul>
<li>Reference actual weights/reps from history, not just ryan.md defaults</li>
<li>Apply progression recommendations from the history section above</li>
<li>If no history for an exercise, use ryan.md baseline</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
