800m swim with technique drills (focus on breathing and form)
Daily Briefing
Your sleep has been consistently below 7 hours over the past few days, indicating fatigue. Focus on technique and form during today&rsquo;s swim, and avoid pushing too hard.
Today&rsquo;s Todos

 Complete 800m swim with technique drills
 Focus on breathing and form during the swim
 Hydrate well before and after the swim
 Stretch for 10 minutes post-swim, focusing on shoulders and core
 Write a short reflection on the swim and how it felt
 Review and update the MVP feature list for today&rsquo;s deep work session. Functionally this task is basically my daily standup. I should be spending more time reviewing tasks from the previous day and mapping to the current day each morning.
 Allocate 2 hours for deep work on the MVP core features

It would be interesting to do a similar cluster study for DC restaurants.\nYou have to fight for your time to write.\nThere’s no statistical evidence that aliens exist out there, it really could just be us.\nGood job swimming today! Bad job getting out of the house. Ryan, you know you have to get out of the house in the mornings to be productive!\nThe Narrative Write about three things you DID today that are not recorded above. One interaction with a human and one place you went.\nSwimming is still really hard for me. I did watch a couple of YouTube videos and natrually, I think my form has been a bit off. I am going to try keeping my shoulders level and bending my elbow more to keep it closer to the surface while pushing water under me rather than doing a motion closer to a full circle. Hopefully that will help.\nI was out of breath often and could not swim more than 50m in a row without stopping. Looking good so far….\n",
