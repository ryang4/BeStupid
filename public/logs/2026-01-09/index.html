Feels like I am constantly running in loops. Try working more backwards from the output rather than trying to fix what is there all of the time.\nSpend some time tomorrow learning how to interact with agents better, you feel stuck despite all of the work you are doing. This is the same feeling you used to have at work, it sucks. Just focus on the shortest path to getting things done.\nWhen claude gets something wrong, we HAVE to update the MD.\nTop 3 for Tomorrow Before bed, write the 3 most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow:\nRefine tasks and break them down so something actually gets done each day. These are too large and it feels like nothing is getting done Post the substack each day ",

<p><em>What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly</em></p>
<p>I NEED to start every coding session with a content plan and desired outcomes. Feels like I am constantly running in loops. Try working more backwards from the output rather than trying to fix what is there all of the time.</p>
<p>Spend some time tomorrow learning how to interact with agents better, you feel stuck despite all of the work you are doing. This is the same feeling you used to have at work, it sucks. Just focus on the shortest path to getting things done.</p>
<p>When claude gets something wrong, we HAVE to update the MD.</p>

<p><em>Before bed, write the 3 most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Refine tasks and break them down so something actually gets done each day. These are too large and it feels like nothing is getting done</li>
<li>Post the substack each day</li>
