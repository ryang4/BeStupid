6mi easy pace (HR &lt;150)
Daily Briefing
Today&rsquo;s Focus: Maintain a steady, easy pace and keep your heart rate below 150 to build endurance without overtaxing your body.

Alerts:

Sleep has been under 6.5hrs for 3 days - consider cutting volume 20% if you feel fatigued.


Tips:

Your HR was 146 on yesterday&rsquo;s short run - aim to keep it under 140 for today&rsquo;s longer run.
You&rsquo;ve been skipping stretching lately - dedicate 10 minutes post-run to stretching, especially your quads, calves, and lower back.
Hydrate well before and after the session to support muscle recovery and performance.

Today&rsquo;s Todos

 Publish substacks and beehives, no exceptions. That does require creating a few images. Ideally this is done before 11 to review with mom.
 Continue iterations on PM, I feel like it&rsquo;s close?
