## Overview

Master ML/AI engineering fundamentals through project-based learning and deployment. Focus on solving personal problems first.

## Philosophy

**Build tools that scratch own itches.** Elite status proven by useful ML systems in daily use, not papers or user counts.

## Project Ideas

1. **Workout Plan Optimizer** - Use training history to suggest optimal progressions
2. **Content Idea Generator** - Analyze past content performance to suggest topics
3. **Log Analyzer** - Extract deeper insights from daily logs
4. **Automated Planning Assistant** - ML-powered daily prioritization

## Learning Resources

- End-to-end ML project courses
- Open source ML library contributions
- Building in public documentation

## Integration with Other Goals

- ML tools can enhance the startup product
- Training data from triathlon journey
- Content from documenting learning
