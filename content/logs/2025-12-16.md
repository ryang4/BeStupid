## Planned Workout
800m swim with technique drills (focus on breathing and form)

## Daily Briefing
Your sleep has been consistently below 7 hours over the past few days, indicating fatigue. Focus on technique and form during today's swim, and avoid pushing too hard.

## Today's Todos
- [x] Complete 800m swim with technique drills
- [x] Focus on breathing and form during the swim
- [x] Hydrate well before and after the swim
- [x] Stretch for 10 minutes post-swim, focusing on shoulders and core
- [x] Write a short reflection on the swim and how it felt
- [x] Review and update the MVP feature list for today's deep work session. Functionally this task is basically my daily standup. I should be spending more time reviewing tasks from the previous day and mapping to the current day each morning. 
- [x] Allocate 2 hours for deep work on the MVP core features

## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*
These days I've been doing my best work late at night. It could be that that coincides with after my workout but it does align better with my habits historically. Maybe stop fighting it and start working with it and life will be a bit easier. That just means go to the gym in the evening and don't feel like you need to get up at 6. 

It does make it hard to find time to read though, which is why mornings could still be valuable.

Some things I learned -- Google maps drives restaurant success due to algorithmic bias when people search for restaurants nearby. It would be interesting to do a similar cluster study for DC restaurants. 

You have to fight for your time to write. 

There's no statistical evidence that aliens exist out there, it really could just be us. 

Good job swimming today! Bad job getting out of the house. Ryan, you know you have to get out of the house in the mornings to be productive!

## The Narrative
*Write about three things you DID today that are not recorded above. One interaction with a human and one place you went.*

Swimming is still really hard for me. I did watch a couple of YouTube videos and natrually, I think my form has been a bit off. I am going to try keeping my shoulders level and bending my elbow more to keep it closer to the surface while pushing water under me rather than doing a motion closer to a full circle. Hopefully that will help. 

I was out of breath often and could not swim more than 50m in a row without stopping. Looking good so far....
