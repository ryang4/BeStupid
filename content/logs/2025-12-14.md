## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*
Today I learned a lot about my friends but I don't write them here. There's a mini monticello near lynchburg virginia. Had a good day with friends and did my run. Could have gotten rolling a bit earlier in the morning to get some work in, drank more than I would have liked. 

## The Narrative
*Write about three things you DID today that are not recorded above. One interaction with a human and one place you went.*
