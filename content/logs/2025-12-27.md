## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*
Almost a completely wasted day. I was able to get 5 hours of work in but wended up going to a friends house for saturday night fun and didn't get my workout out in anything else done in terms of my reflection or anything. It was fun though.
