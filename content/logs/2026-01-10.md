## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*

Not focusing on getting sleep to protect my morning time is ruining my ability to stay on task. Frankly, I need to be able to forgive myself for not getting enough each day. Setting a time to journal and read at night no matter what will make items much easier. 

I learned about Petri agents being used by anthropic to automate testing. I reaffirmed my knowledge that ACID SQL databases are generally a better starting point but can't scale due to their needs to guarantee consitency. 

I touched on the CAP (consitency availability partiition) theory again and learned about PACELC 
-> Partition? Choose availability or consistency
-> Else / Normal? Choose between latency and consistency

Guaranteeing consistency general means that you must wait for your distributed database to reach quorem vs. returning quickly and reaching eventual consistency.
