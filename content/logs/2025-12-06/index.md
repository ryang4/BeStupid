## 📝 The Narrative

First brick workout done! The transition from bike to run was way harder than expected - legs felt like concrete for the first mile. This is going to take practice.

Bike portion felt good on the trainer. Focused on keeping cadence between 85-95 rpm like the protocol said. Heart rate stayed in zone 2 comfortably. Need to get outside soon though, indoor cycling is boring.

The run off the bike was brutal. Quads were screaming. Had to slow down significantly to keep from blowing up. By mile 2 things started to feel more normal. This is definitely a skill I need to develop.

Afternoon content session went well - drafted the Twitter thread about why I'm training while building. Got some good insights from this morning's workout to include.

**Key learnings:**
- Need to practice bike-to-run transitions more
- Nutrition timing was good, felt energized
- 90% compliance feels right - hit the main workout, got content done
- Next week: focus on swim technique (Tuesday's session)
