## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*

Kind of a rough day. I made up for yesterday's lack of a workout with one today. I read something about curating a summary of everything learned in different chats in a second brain. Yes this happens all the time but I actually like the idea of asking a bunch of questions and creating an answer bank instead of a life bank. 

I had a burger today and felt like absolute shit. I have the most energy in the afternoon with a light meal, and eating poorly really impacts my energy levels. 

Likewise, my terrible schedule (work for 6-7 hours, do evening stuff, working another 4-5 hours until 2-3 am) really makes it hard to build solid routines. I'm always too tired to do my habits before bed because I like working until I'm basically falling asleep and vegging on the couch to West Wing. A stricter sleep schedule would go a long way to bumping my reading. 

Intentional reading is critical. I should be taking notes when I read on what I like but I never think about it. 

## Top 3 for Tomorrow
*Before bed, write the 3 most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow:*

1. Send content over to Gabe
2. Ensure network mapping is working and relevant
3. Get LinkedIn integrated properly with the different embedding spaces
4. Deep dive of brands 2025 (look for old run)
5. Reach out to existing customers and see how they are doing
6. Throw up link and article out on the research page
