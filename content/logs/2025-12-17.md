## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*

Workout felt good today. Got a good sweat in and made an effort to stay in zone 2 even though it feels frustratingly slow. Today, I learned that some people out there think the poverty line is $140,000. I also realized I don't really know what being below the poverty line means, whether it's 80k or 140k or whatever. 

I didn't actually get a lot of coding done today, although I did spend some time patching up some security issues and we discussed some critical items about equity moving forward. I ran into an issue where a lot of todos from the prior day made it hard to pick up today. 

## The Narrative
*Write about three things you DID today that are not recorded above. One interaction with a human and one place you went.*
