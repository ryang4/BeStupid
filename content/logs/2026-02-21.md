## What Went Well
- Got a lot of PRs merged — productive work output
- Hit protein target
- Got the brick workout done even with shortened gym time

## What Went Poorly
- Habits got pushed off again until too late — 0/5 streak continuing
- Feeling like comprehension of codebase/systems is slipping

## Top 3 for Tomorrow
1. Write blog post
2. Get evaluation system working with local CLIs and different LLMs
3. Kill rollover todos — scope down or cut anything that's been sitting for 3+ days
