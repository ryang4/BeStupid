## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*
I really don't know if this should count as my daily journaling or not. I don't think it should, I'd like that to be done by hand and frankly all of this gets published to the great big world and I don't want my end of day journal to end up like that. 

I've consistently failed to perform my habits so I docked the entry point for those down significantly. WE only ask for 10 minutes of reading reading and content creation now. If I continue to fail to meet those limits, we will continue knocking the limits down until they are nearly effortless and build from there. I'm also moving my journaling to the morning. If I can replace morning phone time with some journaling that may go a long way and I work until I'm tired and doing this AND journaling feels like a lot.

Considering the amount I have offloaded to claude, I think it should be doable to do some of the reading and such between prompts and reviews. 

## Top 3 for Tomorrow
*Before bed, write the 3 most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow:*

1. Complete network mapping
2. Publish substacks and beehives, no exceptions. That does require creating a few images. Ideally this is done before 11 to review with mom. 
3. Continue iterations on PM, I feel like it's close?
