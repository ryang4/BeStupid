## Training Output
**Strength A — all sets to 1 RIR:**

**Notes:** Bench jumped to 125 (past 120 protocol). Cable rows to 150 (past 145). OHP much more consistent at 75 (10/8/8 vs last week 10/7/3). Triceps and biceps both up from 20→25 lbs. Lunges perfectly consistent. Switched to seated hammy curls — went up to 220 lbs.

## What Went Well
- 4/5 daily habits (writing, reading, yoga, note ideas)
- Great Strength A session — bench to 125, rows to 150, lunges perfectly consistent
- Digital sticky notes for task breakdown kept momentum rolling through the day
- Diet much closer to targets — protein and fiber both hit
- Weighed in this morning (scale-in-path system worked)

## What Went Poorly
- Didn't post Substack note
- Shoulders feel weak — OHP dropped to 75 lbs. Consider switching to seated DB press
- Calories slightly over target
- Several high-priority tasks still rolling over

## Top 3 for Tomorrow
1. Morning task review: break everything into stickies, kill zombies. Specifically address rollovers:
   - Finalize staging env (Google onboarding)
   - Prod status (waiting on cofounder merge)
   - Follow up with parents on funding status + payment plan
   - Legally allocate shares to shareholders
2. Post one Substack note (do it FIRST before opening any work)
3. 12pm webinar

**Workout:** Wednesday = Bike day (45 min, 85-95 RPM, HR <150)
