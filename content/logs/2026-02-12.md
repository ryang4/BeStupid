## What Went Well
- Presentation went great — secured funding
- Created a handwritten physical checklist for features/projects — helps stay on task
- Hit protein target (202g) and got the run in
- Two consecutive days of training (bike + run)

## What Went Poorly
- Could not refocus after the 5pm call
- Start work at 10am, stay up until 1-2am — schedule is shifted and inefficient
- Daily habits (writing, reading, Substack, yoga) all missed again
- Wife was sick, emergency grocery run + dinner + run ate the evening — but the real issue is no buffer because the day started late

## Takeaways
- No couch until 8pm (not just no TV — couch = no work even with TV off)
- Fixed workout times (e.g., run at 9pm no matter what) so the day can be planned around it
- Get out of the house to work — environment drives behavior
- Need to build atomic habits / environment design, not rely on willpower
- Not scheduling or planning makes it impossible to force transitions between tasks

## Top 3 for Tomorrow
1. Deploy production Terraform stack — infra up, Docker images built, health checks passing
2. Fix staging OAuth redirect — get cofounder on a call and resolve it together
3. Write 500 words on evaluating PR reviews with LLMs (Substack draft)

**Gym:** Strength B at 3:30pm (hard deadline — wife's dentist at 4, friends in evening)
