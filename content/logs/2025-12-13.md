## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*
I learned that I need strong external motivation to be successful and what a brick is in triathlon training. Maintaining good email health is borderline too much work and a great opportunity for AI screening and automation. I did catch some lingering subscriptions to
cancel which is good. 

The good news is that I did successfully clean my email and I made some progress planning out the next steps for our project. I also
merged in my big PRs for cluster your tik tok. 

Tmorrow I need to make sure I learn something technical each day that I can write hear and stay focused on my work during the day instead of cleaning emails when I can. That said, I'll be relatively busy tomorrow. 

## The Narrative
*One interaction with a human and one place you went.*

I went to the gym and talked about the holiday sign up bonanza. Turns out the gym will give you a lot of money if you get peple to sign up for some reason.
