## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*

Today sucked, I feel really dumb. My problem solving skills remain bad. I need to do a better job of stepping back and thinking about what I am actually trying to solve rather than just diving in. I also get distracted and jump from task to task too much, like my failure to complete my substack. Granted, I'm also just scared of completing my substack.

I did get in for a workout and I did a good job leveraging pomodoros to stay focused whic hhelped a lot. 

Every problem is another opportunity.

## Top 3 for Tomorrow
*Before bed, write the 3 most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow:*

1. Schedule substack
2. Fix one security issue AND MERGE IT
3. Create one test AND MERGE IT
