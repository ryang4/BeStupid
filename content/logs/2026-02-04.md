- 150m in 2:56
- 50m in 58s
- 50m in 1:07
- 50m in 1:02
- 50m in 1:06

- 100m in 2:07
- 50m in 1:10
- 50m in 46.5s (best split!)

**Technique Notes:**
- **Breathing issues:** Hips drop when breathing, losing momentum
- **Arm entry:** Diagonal entry creating drag, not pushing water directly beneath
- **Shoulder drop:** Impacting overall momentum
- **Form improves with speed:** Felt much better cutting through water during final 50m (46.5s)
- **Focus areas:** Work on breathing technique without hip drop, arm entry perpendicular to body
