## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*
I didn't complete the coding agent because it became overly complex. It's refactored to be simpler and should be up and running early tomorrow morning. Spent significant time on first
blog post, it ships tomorrow. I sent my brother $1000 to hold myself accountable, we will see how it goes. 

Spent a lot of time going over the business plan with Claude. We need market metrics and sales plans to accurately define success. I can't kick that can down the road, it has to happen now.
Any agent I build should be designed to be autonomous and reviewed so I can maximize time working on sales and creating content.

I had my best workout in months today and the weight training side, but I have a lot of sleep to catch up on. I changed the workout plan to a more concise full body workout that's doable in 30-45 minutes designed by Mike Isratel. It has less compound lifts but that may be beneficial now with my ongoing back stiffness anyways.
