## Recovery Protocol Goals
- Restore daily routine without pressure
- Complete 50% of planned activities (better than recent 0%)  
- Focus on 2 core habits consistently
- Build back gradually to prevent repeat pattern

## Weekly Targets (Reduced Volume)

**Cardio Volume:**
- Swim: 400m (reduced from 800m)
- Bike: 30 minutes optional
- Run: 3 miles (reduced from 12 miles)

**Strength:**
- 2 light sessions focusing on movement quality
- Reduced sets/reps to ensure completion

## Recovery Rationale

After missing 4 workouts in 5 days and todo completion below 50%, this protocol prioritizes:

1. **Gentle momentum** over ambitious targets
2. **Completion confidence** with achievable goals  
3. **Routine restoration** before intensity increases
4. **Sustainable habits** rather than catching up

Success metric: Complete 70% of planned activities this week.
