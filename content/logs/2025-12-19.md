## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*
Woke up grumpy. 

I wasted a bunch of time (at least two days?) building out solutions for something that already existed (claude github action). Even more concerning, I was bad at it. I tried to create a general agent for EVERYTHING rather than a general github review agent and wasted a bunch of time. 

Remember, break problems down into small steps and solve them one at a time with tests and you are unstoppable. However, I did finally find a solution that will work with our use case and write a lot for the blog. Focusing myself better on the tasks and timeboxing them helps. Pomodoros work for me when I do them, I am able to meditate on the time.
