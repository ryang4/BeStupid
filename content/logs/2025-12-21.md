## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*
Learned a ton about content strategy with Gabe and the importantce of drilling deep on one strategy and being specific to make content easy to create. Had a great planning session today. Had trouble focusing outside of planning session, I think more pomodoros could be a good meditative focus exercise to hone in on. 

## Top 3 for Tomorrow
*Before bed, write the 3 most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow:*

1. We MUST publish the substack and at least one tiktok
2. Fix outstanding security errors
3. Feature planning for content automation before 9am
