## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*
I learned that seeing old friends is a great way to get energy and not something to fear. Putting off anything to later in the day rarely gets done. Had a great workout this morning but there is a long way to go until I can ride a bike in a triathlon.
