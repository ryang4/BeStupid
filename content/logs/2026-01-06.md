## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*
Couldn't help but to have a late night snack. Very hard to fight my food drive. Ozempic will probably help, but doubling down on tea and having healther snacks like fruit instead of ramen can help mitigate damange. 

I learned that codex is good to pair with claude, and a great strategy for creating content with AI is to have the AI interview me about what I want to do or say rather than me interview the AI for what to do or so.


## Top 3 for Tomorrow
*Before bed, write the 3 most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow:*

1. Literally just all the tasks you did not finish today.
2. Record a 10 minute YouTube video
3. Update BeStupid logs to do workouts more progressively and work on my phone offline
