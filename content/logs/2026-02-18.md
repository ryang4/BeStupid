calories_so_far:: ~4815
protein_so_far:: ~229g
fiber_so_far:: ~36g

## What Went Well
- 5/5 daily habits — second clean sweep in a row (Mon + Wed)
- Bike workout all targets hit: RPM 89 (85-95 ✓), HR 130 (<150 ✓), 12.27 mi (up from 10.12 last week)
- Protein crushed at 229g, fiber hit target at 36g
- Substack note posted first thing (kept the commitment)
- Saved the day with late-night productivity after rough afternoon
- Dinner out with wife

## What Went Poorly
- Calories way over (~4,815 vs 2,500 target) — dinner out was the main hit. Chips, Coke, and fries added ~560 empty calories on top of the enchiladas
- Struggled to get out of the house in the morning
- Lost focus in the afternoon after coming home early to avoid traffic — too many distractions at home
- Late-night productivity will hurt sleep — the cycle continues (late night → bad sleep → slow morning → early afternoon exit → home distractions → late night)
- Did not cancel Run Comfy membership

## Top 3 for Tomorrow
1. Finish merging 5 metric PRs (critical path for prod launch)
2. Write and send Brendan's recommendation letter (early easy win)
3. Continue startup task list (CloudWatch, Google login, system diagram)

**Workout:** Thursday = Run day
**Remember:** Scale in front of dresser tonight. Weigh in tomorrow.
