fiber_so_far:: ~30g

## What Went Well
- Deployed production Terraform stack (Top 1 done)
- Got a workout in despite gym being packed — smart pivot to brick
- Protein hit 221g — best yet
- Secured funding earlier this week, momentum building
- 2/5 Dependabot PRs merged

## What Went Poorly
- Went to bed at 3am despite saying "going to bed now" — lost morning hours
- Only 3 productive work hours instead of planned 5
- Continuing to avoid hard tasks (finishing features, content posts)
- Daily habits (writing, reading, Substack, yoga) all missed again — 0/5
- Calories at ~4,150 — beer added ~600 empty calories, blew past 3,200 ceiling

## Takeaways
- Frustrating pattern of avoiding hard tasks but still made real progress this week (funding, prod deploy, content post)
- Need to document startup process as content — two birds one stone

## Top 3 for Tomorrow
1. Validate prod and staging environment flows end-to-end
2. Metric recording + validate LinkedIn flow (if environments are green)
3. Strength B workout

**Content:** Document the process as part of startup content
