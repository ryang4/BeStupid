## Daily Reflection

**Major Wins:**
- ✅ Fixed AWS deployment issue completely
- ✅ SHIPPED blog post despite perfectionist tendencies
- ✅ Exceeded swim target (775m vs 400m planned)
- ✅ Consistent data logging throughout day
- ✅ **FIRST DAILY MOVEMENT HABIT COMPLETED!**

**Learning & Development:**
- Discovered "thinking agents" use "think step by step" prompts
- Need more systematic 30-60min daily learning routine
- Should leverage Claude code credits more efficiently

**Focus & Productivity:**
- Cheated Cold Turkey by switching browsers (system needs improvement)
- Lost focus after cofounders meeting + Costco run
- Afternoon productivity crash pattern continues
- Successfully avoided perfectionism trap - chose shipping over polishing

**Habit Building Success:**
- ✅ Technical content calendar established (Tues/Fri schedule)
- ✅ Movement habit initiated - post-workout stretching feels natural
- Perfect timing and context (recovery after swim)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Missed daily reading habit
- Need consistent learning rubric/outcomes
- More efficient content development workflows
- Better afternoon refocus strategies after context switches

## Morning Routine Notes
- Did not complete full morning routine
- Had to drive wife to work immediately after waking
- Phone stayed accessible (not phone-free 30 minutes)
- Need better contingency plans for schedule disruptions

## Top 4 for Tomorrow (Tuesday - Strength Day + Content Day)
<!-- Priorities for 2026-02-10 -->
1. **Review slide deck for Thursday presentation** (time-sensitive)
2. **Test staging environment end-to-end** (validate today's AWS fixes)
3. **Write AWS debugging technical post** (Tuesday content calendar)
4. **Clean up PRs:** Start with skill cleanup, then 5 Dependabot PRs

## Learning Notes
- "Thinking agents" key insight: "think step by step" in prompts
- Need systematic approach to AI/ML learning vs. ad hoc discovery

## Sleep Priority
- Going into tomorrow with sleep deficit
- Must prioritize 10 PM phone shutdown tonight for recovery
- Post-stretch relaxation should help with sleep transition
