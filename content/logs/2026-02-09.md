**Morning Reality Check:** Didn't complete full morning routine - had to drive wife to work immediately after waking up

## Today's Todos
- [x] 400m swim session (EXCEEDED - did 775m total!)
- [x] Continue AWS staging environment work (identified root cause!)
- [x] Launch blog post (SHIPPED despite not being happy with it!)
- [x] Data entry consistency improvements (much better today)

## Daily Habits
- [x] Build and share one AI automation (Blog post = content shipped!)
- [ ] 10 min yoga
- [ ] Daily reading (missed)

## Daily Reflection

**Major Wins:**
- ✅ Fixed AWS deployment issue completely
- ✅ SHIPPED blog post despite perfectionist tendencies
- ✅ Exceeded swim target (775m vs 400m planned)
- ✅ Consistent data logging throughout day

**Learning & Development:**
- Discovered "thinking agents" use "think step by step" prompts
- Need more systematic 30-60min daily learning routine
- Should leverage Claude code credits more efficiently

**Focus & Productivity:**
- Cheated Cold Turkey by switching browsers (system needs improvement)
- Lost focus after cofounders meeting + Costco run
- Afternoon productivity crash pattern continues
- Successfully avoided perfectionism trap - chose shipping over polishing

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Missed daily reading habit
- Need consistent learning rubric/outcomes
- More efficient content development workflows
- Better afternoon refocus strategies after context switches

## Morning Routine Notes
- Did not complete full morning routine
- Had to drive wife to work immediately after waking
- Phone stayed accessible (not phone-free 30 minutes)
- Need better contingency plans for schedule disruptions

## Top 3 for Tomorrow
<!-- Before bed, write your 3 most important tasks for tomorrow -->
1. Implement stricter Cold Turkey setup (all browsers)
2. 30-60min structured learning session
3. Test afternoon refocus protocol after external meetings

## Learning Notes
- "Thinking agents" key insight: "think step by step" in prompts
- Need systematic approach to AI/ML learning vs. ad hoc discovery
