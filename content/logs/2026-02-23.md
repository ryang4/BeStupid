## What Went Well
- 5/5 todos done despite doctor's appointment and errands (cashing check)
- Used low-sleep morning strategy: stacked easy wins first (meditation, water) and everything compounded from there
- Stayed out of the house until 5pm to maintain focus
- First 400m continuous swim — PR!
- Blog post finally done and scheduled (no more rolling)
- All recurring goals hit (writing, Substack interaction, yoga)

## What Went Poorly
- Low sleep (5 hrs) — need to protect sleep
- Afternoon lull — likely caused by overeating when getting home, not just being home
- Calorie overshoot (~3,430) — stress eating pattern continues

## Lessons
- Morning momentum hack works: easy wins early → compound effect
- Afternoon lull fix: smaller snacks + stay off couch when home
- Environment still matters — out of house = focused, but can work at home with the right guardrails

## Top 3 for Tomorrow
1. Merge 3 open PRs for Superior coding reviews
2. Diagram out the chat bot architecture
3. Finish wiring staging environment
