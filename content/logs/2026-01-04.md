## Daily Briefing

**Today's Focus:** Maintain a steady, easy pace and keep your heart rate below 150 to build endurance without overtaxing your body.

> **Alerts:**

**Tips:**
- Your HR was 146 on yesterday's short run - aim to keep it under 140 for today's longer run.

## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*

Actually had a really productive day before hanging and drinking with friends to watch sunday night football. It's hard to get this reflection in and wrap up the day string with night activities. I did not have enough time at home today to do the run so I'll have to do it tomorrow. 

Failing to protect my morning and my night led to an overall failure of activities, although I did squeeze in some reading during my working sessions. 

## Top 3 for Tomorrow
*Before bed, write the 3 most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow:*
