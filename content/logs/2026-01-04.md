## Planned Workout

## Daily Briefing

**Today's Focus:** Maintain a steady, easy pace and keep your heart rate below 150 to build endurance without overtaxing your body.

> **Alerts:**
> - Sleep has been under 6.5hrs for 3 days - consider cutting volume 20% if you feel fatigued.

**Tips:**
- Your HR was 146 on yesterday's short run - aim to keep it under 140 for today's longer run.
