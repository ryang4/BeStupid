## THE SINGLE HABIT
**"In bed by [YOUR TIME] with phone in other room"**

## Daily Sleep Protocol

| Day | Sleep Focus | Optional Activities (Only if sleep habit done) |
|-----|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Sunday** | Set bedtime alarm, phone out by 9 PM | 30min walk |
| **Monday** | Repeat sleep routine, track quality | Light strength (if energy high) |
| **Tuesday** | Wind-down 30min earlier than target | Easy swim (if slept 7+ hours) |
| **Wednesday** | Perfect the phone-free bedroom | Recovery walk |
| **Thursday** | Consistency day - no changes | Light strength (if energy high) |
| **Friday** | Week review: what helped sleep? | Easy run (if sleep streak intact) |
| **Saturday** | Prepare for next week's routine | Choice activity or rest |

## Sleep Optimization Rules

### ✅ **Do These (Sleep Enablers)**
- Phone out of bedroom by 9 PM
- Set bedtime alarm 30min before target
- Same wind-down routine every night
- Track sleep quality (1-10) only

### ❌ **Don't Do These (Until Sleep is Consistent)**
- Complex workout tracking
- Multiple daily metrics
- Ambitious todo lists
- Late-night work/planning

## Success Metrics

**Primary (Only Thing That Matters):**
- ✅ In bed on time with phone away: ___/7 nights

**Secondary (Track If Easy):**
- Sleep quality average: ___/10
- Wake time consistency: +/- 30min

## Everything Else is Optional

**Workouts:** Do them if you slept well. Skip without guilt if tired.
**Content:** Create if inspired after good sleep. Don't force it.
**Startup work:** Quality > quantity. 1 hour well-rested > 3 hours tired.
**Nutrition:** Log if you want. Your body will crave better food with better sleep.

## Week Success Definition

**WIN:** Sleep habit completed 7/7 nights
**BONUS:** 2-3 workouts completed without forcing
**IGNORE:** Everything else until sleep is automatic

**Remember:** You've successfully done nutrition and workouts before. They'll come back naturally once you're sleeping well. Master this one habit, everything else follows.
