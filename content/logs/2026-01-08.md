## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*

I reaffirmed that good automated evaluations are the key to good agents. I skipped my workout because I did not get up early enough to do it before hanging out with friends. I feel like I can never remember waht I laerned. starting from fresh with good context is so so much better than using bad context with AI.
