## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*
Git worktrees are Claude's super power. Morning exercise is cruicial for getting the day going. Overall a poor day, started late and had trouble focusing. Very foggy morning. I did do my stretching today though which was nice.
