## What Went Well
- 5/5 daily habits — first clean sweep all week
- Swam 800m (doubled protocol)
- Deployed artifacts with cofounder
- Fixed prod deployment issues (secrets, consolidated workflows)
- Good energy and momentum in the evening

## What Went Poorly
- Missed weigh-in (3rd day in a row)
- Protein missed target (160g vs 180g)
- Calories over again (~3,420)
- Got sidetracked by random tasks at home — didn't finish prod changes after leaving cafe at 3pm
- Did not hit 9 hours of startup work — need better project management and feature prioritization

## Top 3 for Tomorrow
1. Morning review: go over daily tasks, kill zombie tasks, break work into small units
2. Run dry run of polymarket bot + test image/video generator pipeline (2 hour block)
3. Validate prod and staging environment flows end-to-end
