## Daily Reflection
*What is one thing you learned today, one thing went well, and one thing that went poorly*
I learned that homeschooling could be a more viable alternative than I thought before. I learned that game theory dynamics can be 
unique based on teh different network effects of the system. 

I was able to get a lot of work done today at all times of the day (morning, afternoon, evening). 

I gave into an impulse to eat pizza and I did a poor job winding down and I skipped my workout today. If I don't workout in the morning I won't workout at night with my current schedule. 

## The Narrative
*Write about three things you DID today that are not recorded above. One interaction with a human and one place you went.*

I had a very interesting conversation with a woman who offered me a piece of chocolate before telling me that she was related to the
created of John Hopkins university, owned capital one and many of the surrounding business, and that I was going to be taken if 
I was not registered in the next three days. She also said the world bank was made for alien tripods (animal, human, machine), that
she was an original and not a clone, and that I had an antennae in my head, my right foot, and my ass to talk to those around me.
