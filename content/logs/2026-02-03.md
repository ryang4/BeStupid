## Training Output
<!-- Partial workout - stopped early due to lower back tightness -->

**Strength A (Partial Session):**
- Incline bench press: 17, 8, 5 reps @ 115 lbs
- Cable seated row: 17, 10, 8 reps @ 130 lbs (wide grip on final set)
- OHP + Assisted chin-up superset:
  - OHP: 8, 7, 5 reps @ 85 lbs (standing)
  - Assisted chin-ups: 3, 2, 2 reps (medium resistance band)

**Notes:** Stopped workout early due to lower right back tightness (not normal soreness). Good progression on incline bench (17 reps first set) and cable row (increased to 130 lbs). Still struggling with OHP and chin-up progression - no real progress for a while.
