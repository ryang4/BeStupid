## 🤖 AI Rationale

Given that this is the first week and there is no historical data, the protocol focuses on establishing a solid foundation in all areas. The primary goal is to build a strong aerobic base in swimming and cycling while maintaining running fitness. Strength training is scheduled twice a week to preserve muscle mass and prevent injury. The startup goals are aligned with the long-term vision, ensuring that deep work is prioritized while content creation is used to document the journey. The schedule is designed to balance training, recovery, and startup work, with a focus on sustainability and gradual progression.

## 🧬 Human Notes

[Placeholder for Ryan to add his own adjustments/notes]

CRITICAL RULES:
1. If compliance was >85% and sleep >7hrs avg → Increase volume 5-10%
2. If compliance was 70-85% → Hold volume steady
3. If compliance was <70% OR sleep <6.5hrs avg → Reduce volume 10-20%
4. Always include 2x strength sessions (maintain 300 DL, 225 squat)
5. Balance triathlon + startup work (6+ hrs deep work/week)
6. Saturday = brick workout + content creation
7. Sunday = long run day (clear schedule, good for endurance)
8. Monday = recovery/rest day always
