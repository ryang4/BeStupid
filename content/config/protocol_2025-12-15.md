## 🤖 AI Rationale

Given Ryan's profile and the lack of historical data, this protocol focuses on establishing a solid base in swimming and cycling while maintaining his running endurance and strength. The initial swim volume is kept low to focus on technique, which is crucial for a beginner. Cycling starts with indoor training to build form and cadence, essential for efficient biking. Running remains at a moderate volume to leverage his existing base without overloading. Two strength sessions per week ensure he maintains his hard-earned gains. The startup goals are aligned with his MVP launch timeline, ensuring a balanced approach between training and deep work. The content strategy leverages his training experiences to build an engaged audience and validate his product.

## 🧬 Human Notes

CRITICAL RULES:
1. If compliance was >85% and sleep >7hrs avg → Increase volume 5-10%
2. If compliance was 70-85% → Hold volume steady
3. If compliance was <70% OR sleep <6.5hrs avg → Reduce volume 10-20%
4. Always include 2x strength sessions (maintain 300 DL, 225 squat)
5. Balance triathlon + startup work (6+ hrs deep work/week)
6. Saturday = brick workout + content creation
7. Sunday = long run day (clear schedule, good for endurance)
8. Monday = recovery/rest day always
