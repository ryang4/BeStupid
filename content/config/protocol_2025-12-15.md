## 🤖 AI Rationale

Given the lack of performance data from the previous week, we are maintaining a conservative approach while slightly increasing the volume to ensure progressive overload. The swim distance is increased from 800m to 1000m, and the bike session is extended from 60 minutes to 75 minutes. Running volume is increased from 10 miles to 11.5 miles, with a slight increase in the long run from 6 miles to 7 miles. These adjustments are designed to build a solid base while minimizing the risk of overtraining. The focus remains on technique and form in both swimming and cycling, and strength training is maintained to preserve Ryan's PRs. The content strategy continues to document the transition process, providing valuable insights and engagement.

## 🧬 Human Notes

[Placeholder for Ryan to add his own adjustments/notes]

CRITICAL RULES:
1. If compliance was >85% and sleep >7hrs avg → Increase volume 5-10%
2. If compliance was 70-85% → Hold volume steady
3. If compliance was <70% OR sleep <6.5hrs avg → Reduce volume 10-20%
4. Always include 2x strength sessions (maintain 300 DL, 225 squat)
5. Balance triathlon + startup work (6+ hrs deep work/week)
6. Saturday = brick workout + content creation
7. Sunday = long run day (clear schedule, good for endurance)
8. Monday = recovery/rest day always
