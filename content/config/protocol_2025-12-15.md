## 🤖 AI Rationale

Given that this is the first week of the new protocol and there is no prior data, the focus is on establishing a solid foundation in the new disciplines (swimming and cycling) while maintaining the existing running base and strength levels. The swim workout is designed to emphasize technique over distance, which is crucial for a beginner. The bike session focuses on form and cadence to prevent injury and build efficiency. The run and strength sessions are kept at a moderate level to ensure consistency and prevent overtraining. The Saturday brick workout and content creation session will help Ryan practice transitions and document his progress, which is essential for both training and building his audience. The Sunday long run will help build endurance while allowing for a clear schedule to focus on the run.

## 🧬 Human Notes

CRITICAL RULES:
1. If compliance was >85% and sleep >7hrs avg → Increase volume 5-10%
2. If compliance was 70-85% → Hold volume steady
3. If compliance was <70% OR sleep <6.5hrs avg → Reduce volume 10-20%
4. Always include 2x strength sessions (maintain 300 DL, 225 squat)
5. Balance triathlon + startup work (6+ hrs deep work/week)
6. Saturday = brick workout + content creation
7. Sunday = long run day (clear schedule, good for endurance)
8. Monday = recovery/rest day always
