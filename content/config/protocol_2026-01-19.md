## 🤖 AI Rationale

Given Ryan's current state as a beginner in swimming and cycling but experienced in running, this protocol focuses on building a solid base in all three disciplines while maintaining strength. The week starts with a recovery day to ensure Ryan is well-rested, followed by two strength sessions to preserve and build full-body strength. The inclusion of one high-intensity cardio session (running intervals) and one steady-state bike session helps build endurance and speed. The long run on Sunday and the brick workout on Saturday simulate race conditions and prepare Ryan for the demands of a half ironman. The startup goals ensure that deep work is prioritized, and the content strategy leverages Ryan's training experiences to build an audience and validate the product.

## 🧬 Human Notes

[Placeholder for Ryan to add his own adjustments/notes]

CRITICAL RULES:
1. If compliance was >85% and sleep >7hrs avg → Increase volume 5-10%
2. If compliance was 70-85% → Hold volume steady
3. If compliance was <70% OR sleep <6.5hrs avg → Reduce volume 10-20%
4. Always include 2x strength sessions (maintain 300 DL, 225 squat)
5. Balance triathlon + startup work (6+ hrs deep work/week)
6. Saturday = brick workout + content creation
7. Sunday = long run day (clear schedule, good for endurance)
8. Monday = recovery/rest day always
9. HIGH INTENSITY CARDIO: Include exactly ONE high-intensity cardio session per week:
   - Running intervals: 6x400m @ 5K pace with 90s jog recovery, OR 4x800m @ 10K pace
   - Cycling intervals: 5x3min at threshold (RPE 8) with 2min easy spin
   - Schedule on Wednesday or Thursday (NOT on heavy strength days)
   - Alternate between running and cycling each week
10. EXERCISE VARIETY: Ensure workout variety compared to last week:
    - Rotate at least 2 accessory exercises (use variations: incline vs flat, dumbbell vs barbell)
    - Vary rep ranges: if last week was 3x8, try 4x6 or 3x10 this week
    - For cardio: if last week was steady-state, include intervals; if intervals, include a tempo run
    - REFERENCE THE LAST WEEK'S PROTOCOL ABOVE - do not copy it exactly
11. PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD: Use the exercise history data to set specific targets:
    - Reference actual weights/reps from history, not just ryan.md defaults
    - Apply progression recommendations from the history section above
    - If no history for an exercise, use ryan.md baseline
