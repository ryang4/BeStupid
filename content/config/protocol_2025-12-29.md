## 🤖 AI Rationale

This protocol continues to build a solid foundation for Ryan's triathlon transition while maintaining his strength. The increase in swim distance from 800m to 1000m is a logical progression based on his previous compliance and sleep metrics. The focus remains on technique in swimming and form in cycling to prevent injuries and build a strong base. The long run on Sunday builds endurance without compromising recovery. The content strategy aligns with his goals of documenting his journey and building an audience for his startup.

## 🧬 Human Notes

[Placeholder for Ryan to add his own adjustments/notes]

CRITICAL RULES:
1. If compliance was >85% and sleep >7hrs avg → Increase volume 5-10%
2. If compliance was 70-85% → Hold volume steady
3. If compliance was <70% OR sleep <6.5hrs avg → Reduce volume 10-20%
4. Always include 2x strength sessions (maintain 300 DL, 225 squat)
5. Balance triathlon + startup work (6+ hrs deep work/week)
6. Saturday = brick workout + content creation
7. Sunday = long run day (clear schedule, good for endurance)
8. Monday = recovery/rest day always
