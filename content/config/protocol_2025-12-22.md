## 🤖 AI Rationale

This protocol establishes a solid foundation for Ryan's triathlon transition with 2x/week full body strength training. The full body approach on Tuesday and Friday allows for balanced muscle development while leaving adequate recovery between sessions. Swimming moves to Thursday to avoid back-to-back demanding days. The focus on technique in swimming and form in cycling will prevent injuries and build a strong base. The long run on Sunday builds endurance without compromising recovery. The content strategy aligns with his goals of documenting his journey and building an audience for his startup.

## 🧬 Human Notes

[Placeholder for Ryan to add his own adjustments/notes]

CRITICAL RULES:
1. If compliance was >85% and sleep >7hrs avg → Increase volume 5-10%
2. If compliance was 70-85% → Hold volume steady
3. If compliance was <70% OR sleep <6.5hrs avg → Reduce volume 10-20%
4. Always include 2x full body strength sessions (Tuesday/Friday)
5. Balance triathlon + startup work (6+ hrs deep work/week)
6. Saturday = brick workout + content creation
7. Sunday = long run day (clear schedule, good for endurance)
8. Monday = recovery/rest day always
