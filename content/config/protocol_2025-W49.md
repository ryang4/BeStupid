## 🤖 AI Rationale

**Why this protocol works for Ryan:**

**Base Building Focus**: At 245 lbs transitioning from marathon running to triathlon, the priority is building aerobic efficiency across all three sports while managing recovery load. Week 49 establishes baseline volume that's conservative enough to prevent overtraining but progressive enough to drive adaptation.

**Strength Preservation**: Two strength sessions (Mon/Thu) with compound lifts maintains existing strength base (300 DL, 225 squat, 155 bench) without interfering with endurance adaptations. Lower body on Monday allows 48hr recovery before Wednesday run. Upper body on Thursday is isolated from other sessions.

**Swim Priority**: As the newest discipline, swimming gets early-week placement (Tuesday) when you're mentally fresh. 800m total volume with technique drills builds foundation before adding intensity. Pool sessions reduce injury risk vs open water.

**Recovery Architecture**: Sunday full rest day allows weekly supercompensation. Wednesday combines easy run (lowest CNS demand) with deep work for startup. Saturday brick workout mimics race conditions while building transition skills.

**Startup Integration**: Deep work block on Wednesday (mid-week when training load is lowest) plus Saturday afternoon content creation creates consistent output without compromising training. Content strategy leverages unique position as founder/athlete for authentic storytelling.

**Volume Targets**: ~10 miles run, ~90min bike, ~1000m swim is appropriate Week 1 volume for someone with running base but new to multisport. Allows assessment of swim/bike capacity before Week 50 progression.

## 🧬 Human Notes

**Adjustments based on feel:**
- If legs feel heavy Tuesday, swap swim and run days
- If sleep <6.5 hours on any night, prioritize recovery over workout
- If startup demands surge, cut Friday bike to 45min (don't skip strength)
- Weather permitting, take Saturday brick workout outside for variation

**Nutrition focus this week:**
- Fuel morning workouts (banana + coffee minimum)
- Hit 180g+ protein daily to support strength maintenance
- Hydrate: 1 gallon+ water per day (especially pre/post workouts)
- Prep Sunday: Batch cook proteins and carbs for the week

**Learning priorities:**
- Swim: Ask coach/YouTube for breathing pattern feedback
- Bike: Dial in saddle height and cleat position
- Run: Practice keeping HR <150 (aerobic base, not marathon pace)
