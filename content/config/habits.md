# Habit Configuration

Edit the habits list above to customize your daily tracking. Each habit needs:
- `id`: A unique identifier (used internally for streak tracking)
- `name`: The display name shown in your daily log
- `setup_action`: Environment design step to reduce friction and make the habit easier

These habits will appear as checkboxes in your daily logs. Check them off as you complete them.
