## AI Rationale

Given the lack of data from the previous week, this protocol starts conservatively to establish a solid base for triathlon training while preserving Ryan's strength. The swim and bike sessions are kept short and focused on technique to avoid overwhelming Ryan, especially since he is new to these disciplines. The run volume is maintained at a manageable level to leverage his existing marathon base without overloading his system. Strength training is scheduled twice a week to ensure balanced development and injury prevention. The brick workout on Saturday is designed to practice transitions, which is crucial for triathlon success. The active recovery day on Sunday ensures that Ryan has time to recover and prepare for the next week's training. This balanced approach aligns with Ryan's goal of achieving top 0.01% performance sustainably over the long term.
