## AI Rationale

Given Ryan's current state and the lack of compliance and sleep data from the previous week, this protocol is designed to start with a manageable volume and intensity to ensure consistency and prevent burnout. The week begins with a recovery day to ensure Ryan is well-rested for the upcoming challenges. The strength sessions are slightly increased in volume and intensity to promote progressive overload while maintaining form and preventing injury. The high-intensity cardio session on Wednesday is adjusted to 4x800m intervals to provide a metabolic challenge without overloading the body. The swim workout on Thursday continues to focus on technique, which is crucial for a beginner. The brick workout on Saturday combines biking and running, simulating race conditions and providing valuable content for his audience. The long run on Sunday helps build endurance and mental toughness. The startup goals are integrated to ensure that his business continues to progress alongside his training. This balanced approach aims to build a solid foundation for Ryan's triathlon training and startup efforts.

## Startup Goals
- Complete core features for MVP launch
- Acquire 10 beta users by end of week
- Publish 2 pieces of content documenting startup progress
