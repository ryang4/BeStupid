## Training Philosophy
- All sets to **1 rep in reserve (1 RIR)** — stop when you could do one more
- **Supersets** where marked to keep sessions tight
- Progression rule: if first set hits 12+ reps at 1 RIR, add 5 lbs next week
- Log reps as you go — no fixed rep targets, just weight and effort

## Volume Progression Plan

| W08 | 3 sets | Push reps higher at same weight |
| W09 | 4 sets | Add volume |
| W10 | 4 sets | Push weight if reps are high |
| W11 | Deload | Drop to 2 sets, reduce weight 10% |

## Cardio Targets
- Swim: 400-800m (based on energy)
- Bike: 45 minutes
- Run: 4 miles
- Brick: 30+20 min

## Key Rules
- Log every set (weight x reps) — this is how we progress
- Wear the Garmin for every cardio session
- If gym is packed (Fridays), go earlier or swap to Saturday
