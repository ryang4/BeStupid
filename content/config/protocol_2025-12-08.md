## 🤖 AI Rationale

Given Ryan's profile and the lack of historical data, this protocol focuses on establishing a solid base in the new disciplines of swimming and cycling while maintaining his running endurance and strength. The weekly schedule is designed to balance triathlon training with sufficient recovery and deep work for startup development. 

- **Swimming**: Starting with a manageable 800m to focus on technique and build confidence in the water.
- **Cycling**: 60 minutes on the indoor trainer to develop form and cadence without the added stress of outdoor conditions.
- **Running**: Keeping runs at a moderate distance and intensity to leverage his existing base while avoiding overtraining.
- **Strength**: Two strength sessions per week to maintain his current PRs and prevent muscle loss.
- **Recovery**: A full rest day on Monday to ensure he starts each week fresh and a long run on Sunday to build endurance.

This balanced approach ensures Ryan can sustain his efforts over the long term, achieving both his triathlon and startup goals.

## 🧬 Human Notes

[Placeholder for Ryan to add his own adjustments/notes]

CRITICAL RULES:
1. If compliance was >85% and sleep >7hrs avg → Increase volume 5-10%
2. If compliance was 70-85% → Hold volume steady
3. If compliance was <70% OR sleep <6.5hrs avg → Reduce volume 10-20%
4. Always include 2x strength sessions (maintain 300 DL, 225 squat)
5. Balance triathlon + startup work (6+ hrs deep work/week)
6. Saturday = brick workout + content creation
7. Sunday = long run day (clear schedule, good for endurance)
8. Monday = recovery/rest day always
