# **About Me**

Hi! Thanks for visiting my blog! I've broken my about me page into two sections, what I know about myself and what I don't know about myself. 

I hope this helps you understand a bit about who I am.

## **What I Know About Myself**

- I am a software developer. Monday through Friday I wake up, I write code, and I design technical solutions to buisness problems if I don't know what code to write. 
- My favorite food is cheddar cheese. Sometimes I think my favorite food may be something else, like meatballs, but it always comes back to cheddar cheese. 
- I love to play outside. I play pickup frisbee and there is something addicting about running as fast as you can outdoors. 
- I want at least two kids. I've always wanted kids. It's hard to describe why raising kids is so important to me. Maybe it's just natural instinct. 
- I value peace of mind more than anything. This idea leads into another principle of mine which is that my location is not important. I have made various amounts of money, admittedly not life changing money, but I've lived a good life which is why my depression can be so frustrating. I hope doing this blog helps, but we'll see!
- I love feeling the the sun but I don't wear enough sunscreen. This truth is simple and science backed. 
- I love my family and my friends. One of my goals for this blog is to challenge the idea that great success cannot occur with a normal life. I value my relationships and plan on maintaining them, plus [Harvard says they're good for you](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/).
- I am happiest when I am working on something I think is fun. I am a simple man, I like to have fun, and I like to smile. 

## **Questions I still have about myself**

- What is the healthiest version of me? I've been to so many nutritionists and doctors and talked to so many mentors and yet I don't know what best version of myself I should be striving for.
- What is my why, for everything? I know I love my family and my friends, but are they enough to motivate me to be great when they love me for who I am? I hope to learn a lot through this blog, including finding some long term why(s) for me to put on a wall somewhere.
- How do I balance, family, friends, sleep, fitness, and professional pursuits? Life pulls in so many different directions, what opportunity costs are best for me when all of the above seems to be so important?
- Where do I want to be in 5 years? I don't even know where I want to be in one year.
- How will I take care of my future family? I don't think there is any way to answer this question completely. I know I want them to be happy, but how?
