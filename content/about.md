# About Me

# Overview

We all get here at some point don't we? A point in life where we ask the questions people have always asked:

- Why am I here?
- What do I want to do with my life?

Here is what I know about myself. I want kids, but not yet. Until I'm ready for kids, and who knows when that will be, this blog will have to serve as my purpose. 

I'm reading a great book *Outlive* by Peter Attia that describes how and why different actions such as exercise, protein, intake, anything a human can do, contributes to an individuals ability to live a long and healthy life while avoiding the [Horsemen](https://peterattiamd.com/peter-on-the-four-horsemen-of-chronic-disease/) that kill humans the most. 

Peter does a great job breaking down complex topics in the book but also breaking down long term strategy. As humans, it's very hard to think long term. Our world today is full of short term gratification from donuts to Netflix to bimontly paychecks, but goals such as increasing longevity and finding one's passion throughout life have extremely long time horizon's: our entire lives! 

I'm going to break down my approach to finding passion similar to how Peter breaks down the approach to longevity by focusing on the Objective, Tactics, and Strategy needed to acheive my goals. 

# Objective

My objective is to have flexible lifestyle that allows me to spend time AND energy with my friends and family.

My are my relationships. It's weird because not all of the relationships that matter to me exist. I don't have children or a wife yet but I'm working on it, but I do have parents, a sibling, grandparents, and extended family members that I can better support. I simply love to love people, and I want to maximize those experiences. So how do I do that?

To maximize my time and energy with my family, I need to maximize my available time and energy. Let's dive into the strategies I'll use to acheive this objective.

# Strategy

How do I maximize time and energy? Let's break it down into two separate sections: a strategy for time and a strategy for energy.

# Time Maximization Strategy

Time is a limited resource. Currently (I will not say it's impossible), I cannot obtain more time than I have, my time is finite. The finite reality of time implies that the time maximization problem is a reallocation problem: how can I reallocate my time so that I can spend more of my time with my family? In other words, how can I maximize my time such that I can prioritize my time how I choose? 

From this high level question comes I can deduce a specific strategy: maximize my time with family reallocating as much time as I have into 'free time' that allows me to choose what to do with it.  

# Energy Maximization Strategy

My strategy for maximizing energy is to focus on maximizing my health. To some that may seem synonymous and I'd agree, but when I tie health back to my bigger why, my family, the reason health is important is because of the energy it gives that allows me to support my family.

I don't want to simply spend my time with my family, I want to live with them. I want to run with my kids, dance with my wife, travel, and support my relatives. To do these things, I need to be mentally and physically healthy. Energy drinks and coffee can only take me so far. 

The definition of 'healthy' is always debated and I am not going to redefine what healthy means here. I only need a strategy to push me to maximize my health and thus, energy. The health problem is a little more complex than the time problem because there is a variety of vectors that need to be developed, but these vectors very measureable and relatively easy to do in comparison. Overall, my primary strategy to maximize health is to:

- Increase lean muscle (without steroids or risk of injury)
  - Bench 1x bodyweight
  - Squat 1.25x bodyweight
  - Deadlift 1.5x bodyweight
  - Lose 10 lbs
- Increase VO2 max to top 2% of population
- Track my nutrition everyday
  - Eat 200g of protein per day
  - Aim for 40g of fiber per day
- Sleep at least seven hours per day
- Get sunlight / vitamin D

Considering all there is to know about health, this list is short. I will come back to it later when it makes sense to increase these goals, or add more complexity. For example, I want to use a continuous glucose monitor at some point, but I don't have the equipment to start that today, so it's not on the list. Maybe it will be tomorrow.

You may have noticed that mental health is not mentioned here. My relationship with mental health is too long to include in this post, but part of my strategy for mental health is this blog! This blog is meant to help me find meaning in my life, and to hold myself accountable to the goals that matter to me.... like the ones listed in this post! I will have other posts that detail my strategies with mental health.

# Tactics

Now that I have an objective - support and provide for my family as best as I can, and a strategy - maximize my time and energy, we can dive into the tactices. How do I live my life day to day that follows my strategy and allows me to strive for my objective?

# Time Tactics: A Day in the Life of Ryan

To solve the time reallocation problem, let's investigate the current time allocation, and see how much of my time is flexible, such that I can prioritize it how I wish.

To start, I'm only looking at weekdays. I will keep my weekends variable for now because I can't fight all the zombies at once, I need to take them one at a time.

- 0:00-6:00: Sleep
- 6:00: Wake up, minor activities, head to gym
- 6:30-7:30: Gym/fitness
- 7:30-8:15: Shower, some form of commute
- 8:15-17:00: Work
- 17:00-18:30: Varies, usually a commute and/or some form of workout
- 18:30-19:30: Cook dinner
- 19:30+: Flexible time
- 22:00-23:59: Sleep

So my initial total allotment of flexible time is 2.5 hours per day. Not a lot! Now, let's look at these time blocks one by one and see which ones can reallocated to flexible time.

- Sleep is not flexible time, it is mandatory sleeping time, next block
- Waking up will always come with some minor activities, and optimizing here will only increase allotment of flexible time by minutes, so it's not worth the trouble of maximizing now
- Gym/Fitness can be elimintated but it's integral to second goal, energy, so it is not flexible time
- Showe/commute I combined these because my showers are usually bookended by some sort of walk or commute. My morning showers are quick, usually 2-3 minutes, My commute is longer. It takes me ~10-15 minutes to get to and from a gym and ~30 minutes to get to work on days I go into the office (two days per week). Sometimes it takes me an hour to get home, so there is room for improvement here. Let's mark as potential flexible time.
- Not much to say about work other than that my current job is kind of flexible. I don't always have to go in, I can leave early, and because I can work from anywhere I have some flexibility to dedicate some time to family as is, but not really energy. Let's mark as potentially flexible time.
- Commute home/workout - same as morning commute, potentially flexible time
- Cooking dinner could be eliminated or alleviated but cooking is important to me. I find it helps me destress and cooking myself makes it easy to acheive my dietary goals each day. Still, it can be replaced and isn't integral to my goals (someone else can cook for me), so it's potentially flexible time.

Of the 13.5 hours of non-sleep or flexible time in my current schedule, 12 hours are potentially flexible and could be reallocated. 


# Components of Family Support

Okay, so now I know that my 'why' is my currently semi-exisestant family. How do I focus on my family? There are two items I want to maximize that I think allows me to be there for my family when I'm needed:
- Time
- Energy

Of course, supporting a family means spending time with them. It also means spending focused time. I don't want to go to events to support my family and be checking my phone the whole time. I want to be focused on them.

Energy is also extremely important. To take care of my family and be there for them I need the energy to do so. I want to play sports with my kids, and help my parents move when they are older. To support others takes energy.

# The Tactics

So how does this blog serve as my purpose?

I created a list of topics that could potentially answer the 'what do I want to do with my life question,' listed below.
- Get metabolically healthy
- Become a meditation guru
- Start an online business
- Build my own top to bottom web 3 project
- Create videos/develop a social media presence
- Create a VR game
- Make people laugh everyday

Note that the list is longer than one item and in my experience it was impossible to do everything. To navigate this problem I can only work on one item on the list at a time. I stop focusing on the selected item when one of two things happen:
- I've developed a habit I'm happy with so I can continue working on item without spending too much will power and focus on said item
- I don't want to do it anymore

I will dive more into the first point later in this post, but I want to talk more about the second reason to stop, which is not wanting to do it anymore. At a high level, this out makes sense. Life is too short to do things we don't want to do. This blog, and my mission, is to find my passion, something that makes me excited and energized to work on everyday. If working towards something on my list does not give me this feeling, I'm going to stop and start something else. However, that makes it very easy to quit, so I also timebox each item to 30 days or 30 hours, whichever comes last. Obviously the goal is to spend each day of a month spending one hour on said task. The timeboxing comes with consistency which leads to habit forming and will feed some montly experimental tasks into long term habits. 

# 'Uncle' Points

 and work diligently on these topics for 30 days. As I work diligently towards these topics, I'll create weekly blog posts and supplement with short videos <tk> insert link to tik tok <tk> to hold myself accountable. 

In addition to these short burts, closed scope goals, there are a few long term continuous goals that I will keep readers updated on. These continuous goals relate to health, physical and mental, so I can build a foundation for a long and happy life. I spent a ridiculous amount of my childhood and 20s depressed, and I've found that consistent exercise and healthy eating is the best cure. The starter goals for health and fitness are:

- Bench 225 LBS (currently at 145 LBS)
- Squat 350 LBS (currently at 205 LBS)
- Deadlift 400 LBS (currently at 235 LBS)
- Get a six pack (currently at 1/6)
- Track my eating for 90% of days over the next six months

These goals will be udpated as I acheive them.

The first short burts goal is starting on online business. I hear it's easy to do these days, let's see how far I can get in 30 days. Check back in for updates! 

It's important to recognize where all of these goals lead over time. My number one goal is to have a strong and happy family. I believe the most imporant things I can do to acheive that goal is to become as healthy as possible now so that I can maintain my longevity and take care of my family for decades. 

In addition to physical health, mental health is extremely important. I believe finding work that I love and am passionate is vital for my long term mental health and directly connected to my ability to be there my family mentally as well as physically. As long as I don't love it too much.

Here we go!
