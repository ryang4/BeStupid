The [Finnish proverb](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11513957-there-s-a-finnish-saying-onni-ei-tule-etsien-vaan-elaen) "Happiness is not found by searching, but by living" inspired this idea by concisely highlighting one of life's truths: lasting happiness comes with action. However, it's not just about doing something, but committing the time to it to do it well. 

I know these aren't groundbreaking ideas. I am not the only human being in the world who has spent countless hours doing nothing with ideas richocheting around my head, like I'm in one of those gimmicky money booths that blow dollar bills everywhere but catching and holding onto a bill feels impossible.

I want to do things and I want to spend time doing them, but how long? It's too easy to 'work' on something forever. I stumbled upon a [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4PzOjM5BJQ) with Chris Williamson and entrepreneur Alex Hormozi, who introduced a concept I found compelling: time should be measured in 100 hour blocks. While 100 hours is not the mammoth 10,000 hours, it's enough time to explore a topic and it forces me to break my project down into something achievable in 100 hours. After 100 hours, if I like what I'm doing, I can always set a new 100 hour goal relevant to the same topic. Additionally, there are a lot of things I want to try, so I appreciate the flexibility of an 'end.'

So, I've adopted this 100-hour rule. This blog will chronicle these 100-hour journeys. I'll offer bi-weekly updates and daily vlogs, detailing the tasks and the routines that guide me towards my Zenith Self, whatever they may be.

This blog will focus on doing things for 100 hours at a time. I will give bi-weekly blog updates on these things daily vlogs on my task as well as my day to day routine to maintain my Zenith self and to keep my time tracked.

My first 100 hour block is starting on online business.

Join me, and let's hear what you're committing your 100 hours to. Check back for updates, and here's to each hour pushing us closer to our Zenith Self. 

Dream big out there,

Ryan
