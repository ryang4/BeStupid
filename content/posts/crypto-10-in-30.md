# 10 Goals in 30 Days

## Goal of Project

Due to a viciously recurring existential crisis I'm desparately starting a new project that I will follow through on (this time??). I've had this idea kicking around in my head for awhile and it's still there so it's time to do something about it.

I struggle with holding onto and developing connections with people in today's world. I've never been good at social media, it feels too curated for me, and with all of the distractions, mobility, and rat-racing pressure in life today it's been hard for me to find, make, and hold onto the important connections I have with my friends and family. 

To solve this I will through myself into a project I will work on with nobody but myself and that most of my friends or family won't use.

Such is life.

The goal is to create a crypto app that allows users to generate a unique image, or version of themself, that they can display on the site (or a website) if they purchase a time token. Each time token is related to one specific block of time, and only one. Ideally, it is extremely difficult for users to purchase more than one time block token, but that's a problem for later. Time block tokens will be released a month in advance for the next month, and they will represent one minute in timespace. 

The end result should be a global time capsule, where everyone gets (or had) their 15 minutes of fame that they can query and relive (or rather look at again) any time they want once the time passes.

I also want to annonymously track what people say and input, for some sort of global word cloud. 

With that idea in mind, let's come up with 10 goals to acheive over the next month for this project. This goals need to be measureable and attainable, and crucially, not too hard because I've never done this before and need to feed my brain little goldfish it can handle instead of a great white. 

## 10 Goals
1. Make a website that can store user input. The input only needs to be stored in the browser for this goal.
2. Using some sort of AI tool, aggregate the the user input into an annonymous, but uniquely seeded image based on the user input. 
3. Pick a blockchain and/or token to use for me site. This effort is largely driven by the need to peg a token to a time block. I really have no idea how I'm going to do this but it's a crucial step. Maybe NFT's are a viable route here. 
4. Integrate the website with a crypto wallet. This is my first project, so I will likely choose ETH because it has the most support or Aptos because I know a guy
who can give me pointers.
5. Write my first smart contract. Really it can be anything, just write my first one! Oh, connect to test net. 
6. Write a smart contract that stores images on the block chain. These images must be queryable by a timestamp interval of 15 minutes. 
7. Store the source user data, annonymously, in addition to the annonymous image. I don't currently know if this is possible.
8. Create a basic word cloud of the words used to create said images. We can always add more data tracking later, and that could get expensive, there are a lot of words out there. Maybe I will timebox the words to the past year, month, or week. Let's be real though, the all-time data is pretty sweet to have. 
9. Fill out the rest of the site content. This may seem like a lot but should mostly be words and such. An about the project, describing the tokenomics of how I somewhow stitched this together, and what users should be excited for. 
10. Launch! 

Critically, I want to complete item 10 even if the rest of the site is not ready for show yet. There is no motivation to improve like launching a broken product. 
Today is March 20th, 2023, so 30 days would be April 20th, 2023. I will start tomorrow, so we will bump it to April 1st for my own sanity. 

God speed, to me.
