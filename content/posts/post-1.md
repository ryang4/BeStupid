We all get here at some point don't we? A point in life where we ask the questions people have always asked:

- Why am I here?
- What do I want to do with my life?

Today, there is only one thing I know I want to do with my life: have kids. However, that requires some maturity and a willing partner so this blog will have to suffice for now. 

My plan is create a list of topics that could potentially answer the 'what do I want to do with my life question' and work diligently on these topics for 30 days. As I work diligently towards these topics, I'll create weekly blog posts and short, daily videos <tk> insert link to tik tok <tk> to hold myself accountable. 

In addition to these short burts, closed scope goals, there are a few long term continuous goals that I will keep readers updated on. These continuous goals relate to health, physical and mental, so I can build a foundation for a long and happy life. I spent a ridiculous amount of my childhood and 20s depressed, and I've found that consistent exercise and healthy eating is the best cure. The starter goals for health and fitness are:

- Bench 225 LBS (currently at 145 LBS)
- Squat 350 LBS (currently at 205 LBS)
- Deadlift 400 LBS (currently at 235 LBS)
- Get a six pack (currently at 1/6)
- Track my eating for 90% of days over the next six months

These goals will be udpated as I acheive them.

The first short burts goal is starting on online business. I hear it's easy to do these days, let's see how far I can get in 30 days. Check back in for updates! 

It's important to recognize where all of these goals lead over time. My number one goal is to have a strong and happy family. I believe the most imporant things I can do to acheive that goal is to become as healthy as possible now so that I can maintain my longevity and take care of my family for decades. 

In addition to physical health, mental health is extremely important. I believe finding work that I love and am passionate is vital for my long term mental health and directly connected to my ability to be there my family mentally as well as physically. As long as I don't love it too much.

Here we go!
