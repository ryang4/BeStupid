There are three primary reasons I am starting this blog:
1. To focus my energy
2. To help with my mental health
3. To hold myself accountable

### **To Focus My Energy**

I always have ideas bouncing around my head but I don't do anything about them. I don't feel like there is something I have an extreme passion for and as a result all my energy is wasted thinking about things, starting some projects and never really committing to them. I want to use this blog to maintain focus on a single task for a long period of time. Hopefully I discover some passion along the way.

I will hone my energy to one topic for at least 100 hours, just one topic at a time, for a maximum of 100 days (one hour per day). After 100 hours, I will pick another topic to work on diligently. I will continue this process until I find some niche that I love and decide to stick with.

I will provide progress on my task in a weekly post, and I will post daily videos of me working on my tasks.

Welcome to a blog of passion discovery, one doable topic at a time.

### **To Help With My Mental Health**

I've struggled with depression my whole life. I don't really know why. Not knowing why is the most frustrating thing about my depression, other than maybe when other people tell me what to do to cure it.

I've noticed that a variety of good habits help me with my mental health:
- Writing
- Exercies, particularly outdoors
- Reading and learning
- Meditation

Creating a routine and maintaining consistency is hard. Writing about my progress in these constant areas, separate from the 100 hour passion driven tasks, will help me develop the good habits I need to live a happy life.

Welcome to a blog not just of passion discovery, but also of mental vulnerabilities and the difficulties of trying to live a 'healthy' lifestyle.

### **To Hold Myself Accountable**

For me, giving up is too easy. My life has always been too comfortable and lacked hardship that I think really spurs motivation in some people. I need additional, external motivation as much as I'd love to be able to rely on my internal motivation alone. This blog is my creation of that external motivation.

How does this blog provide external motivation? 

Simply put, I'm scared that someone out there, my family, my friends, my cousins, anyone, will discover this blog and find a steaming pile of crap, of unfished work, unrealized potential. The readers may not exist yet, but their possibility is all I need for now to drive this fear home. 

Using this fear of mediocrity, of unfinished work, in conjunction with my desire to create something, anything, I'll find some work I love to do, and a life I love to live.

Here we go!
