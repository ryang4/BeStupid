# The Blog

Why I am starting this blog? 

I've struggled with my mental health as long as I can remember. I first wrote that I wanted to die when I was in the 2nd grade, and I attempted suicide, rather undramatically, in 10th grade. Since then I've battled depression on and off will certainly continue with the ups and downs of depression in the future. I'm starting this blog because I need an outlet for my thoughts and some made up accountability to pursue all of thoughts that bounce around in my head. 

The mental outlet, the focus, the passion is what this blog is for.

Back to all of those thoughts bouncing around my head -- I can never choose simply one thing to focus on, and so I end up focusing on nothing at all. 

My goal with this blog is to try and hone that energy to one topic per month, just one! Each month, I will pick one topic to work on diligently. I want to be an expert on that topic by the end of each month, or at least learn enough about it that I know whether or not said topic is something I am truly passionate about.

So each month I will pick one topic to focus on. I will write a bi-weekly post, or weekly if needed, progress update, and I will try to take videos along the way! 

Welcome to the blog of passion discovery, one doable topic at a time.
