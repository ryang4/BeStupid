# Notes on a Trip to Cuba

Soemtime during the fall of 2022 my parents asked me if I wanted to join them on a trip to Cuba. I said yes because who says no to such questions? Billionaires probably, but I'm no billionaire. This trip was my family revenge trip -- my parents took my little brother abroad while I was still in school and didn't go. This time my little brother is still and school so he couldn't join us on this trip. He was also concerned that Cubans wouldn't like Americans, and had some horror stories about AK-47s on the runways, so it was good trip for the three of us (Mom, Dad and I) to take without him.

# Details of the Trip

There are still several travel restrictions for US residents going to Cuba. These restrictions can be avoided by flying from another country (looking at you Canada) but my parents opted for a guided trip to "Support the Cuban People" which is sanctioned by the US government. Unofficially, "Supporting the Cuban People" means "Avoid Supporting that Communist Government." We could not stay in hotels or resorts - they are government owned. We also could not go to places just to go there, there had to be some educational or supportive condition behind it. So no long walks on the beach, and more time at museums and local shops and community centers. The trip itinerary was packed with activities, including a lot of bus rides from point A to point B, so I never felt bored at any point during the trip.

# Background Knowledge

I didn't think too much about Cuba and it's history before the trip. Sure I knew about Fidel Castro and Che Guevara and the revolution, the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban missle crisis, but to me all of those things happened long ago and the modern day US embargo was a leftover grudge from a previous era. As always, the relationship between the US and Cuba is more complex than it seems.

It's easy to forget that many people who lived throught the revolution and the missle crisis are still alive today. They experienced the revolution and saw it's direct impacts. It's also easy to glorify the US, especially as someone who grew up in the US. The situation for many Cubans under the dictator Bautista was very exploitive, led by the dominance and abuse of American companies in the country. When Castro took over and nationalized those companies (without paying for them) many Americans and Cubans who were profiting from those companies left. Not ideal, and led to an embargo. 

# The Group

I think the best part of doing a group tour is the group! My parents sa that this group was better than previous groups they've been with, and it was a pretty interesting group. We had succesful professionals in legal and finance, a preschool teacher, air force veteran and a nurse. It was a lot of fun.
