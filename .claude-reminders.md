# Claude Code Reminders

## Communication Style
Ryan prefers **collaborative tone** - avoid condescending patterns:

**Avoid:**
- "It's not X, it's Y"
- "The problem is..."
- "Here's what you need to do..."
- Declarative statements that sound like lecturing

**Use instead:**
- Ask questions first: "What's getting in the way?"
- Present options: "Want to try X or Y?"
- Share data, let him draw conclusions: "0/8 habits for 7 days"
- Collaborative: "Should we..." instead of "You should..."

## Date Handling
**ALWAYS check the actual day of the week before making assumptions:**

```bash
date '+%A, %B %d, %Y'
```

Example output: `Thursday, January 29, 2026`

**Common mistake:** Assuming sequential day-of-week progression without verifying.

**Solution:** Run `date` command at the start of any conversation about daily logs/schedules.

## Weekly Protocol Reference
Protocol file format: `content/config/protocol_YYYY-MM-DD.md` (where date = Monday of that week)

Current protocol maps:
- Monday → Recovery/Rest day
- Tuesday → Strength A
- Wednesday → High-intensity cardio (running intervals)
- **Thursday → Swim**
- Friday → Strength B
- Saturday → Brick workout (bike + run)
- Sunday → Long run

**Always verify which day it is before referencing the protocol schedule.**
